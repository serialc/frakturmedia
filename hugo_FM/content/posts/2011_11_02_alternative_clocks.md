A day has 24 hours in it. That’s 1,440 minutes or 86,400 seconds. If you wonder why Americans don’t understand the need for using the metric system then ask yourself why you use this inconsistent time measurement system.

What if we could design a better time system that is easier to read and convert between units? Would it still have the same number of hours, minutes or seconds in a day?

### Update
It turns out this idea of decimal tiem isn't so novel. The French republican calendar, in 1791-ish, defined a 10-hour day with 100 minutes per hour and 100 seconds per minute. The months also changed.
